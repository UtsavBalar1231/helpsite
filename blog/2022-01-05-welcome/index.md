## About me (Geeky stuff)
**Greetings! I am Utsav Balar, a wannabe software developer and a student at C.G.P.I.T college of engineering and technology.**

Some of the projects that i had worked on are:
- [hentaiOS](https://github.com/hentaiOS)
- [Project 404](https://github.com/P-404)
- [RevengeOS](https://github.com/RevengeOS)

- [Immensity Kernel for xiaomi snapdragon 865 devices](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250/)
- [Immensity Kernel for samsung exynos 9611/9610 devices](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_samsung_universal9611/)

In my free time, I like to watch movies, dramas, read web comics, and do a bit coding with some electronic music.

I'll be posting more blogs about programming and other geeky stuff here soon.
