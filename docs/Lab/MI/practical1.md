## To study the various machine learning libraries like - Scipy, Sklearn, Keras, TensorFlow with their usage

# Numpy:

- NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'.
- It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

- ## Operations using NumPy:

  - Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
  - Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
  - Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation

# Scipy:

- Scipy is a scientific computing package for Python. scipy imports all the functions from numpy namespace.
- The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical practices such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
- SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
- Scipy Extends NumPy providing additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.

# Pandas:

- Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.
- Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.

- ## Key Features of Pandas:

  - Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.
  - Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.
  - Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
  - Reshaping and pivoting of date sets.
  - Label-based slicing, indexing and subsetting of large data sets.
  - Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted.
  - Group by data for aggregation and transformations.
  - High performance merging and joining of data.
  - Time Series functionality.

# Sci-Kit learn (sklearn):

- Sklearn or Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.
- It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.

- ## Features:

  - Rather than focusing on loading, manipulating and summarising data, Scikit-learn library is focused on modeling the data. Some of the most popular groups of models provided by Sklearn are as follows −
  - Supervised Learning algorithms − Almost all the popular supervised learning algorithms, like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree etc., are the part of scikit-learn.
  - Unsupervised Learning algorithms − On the other hand, it also has all the popular unsupervised learning algorithms from clustering, factor analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to unsupervised neural networks.
  - Clustering − This model is used for grouping unlabeled data.
  - Cross Validation − It is used to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data.
  - Dimensionality Reduction − It is used for reducing the number of attributes in data which can be further used for summarisation, visualisation and feature selection.
  - Ensemble methods − As name suggest, it is used for combining the predictions of multiple supervised models.
  - Feature extraction − It is used to extract the features from data to define the attributes in image and text data.
  - Feature selection − It is used to identify useful attributes to create supervised models.
  - Open Source − It is open source library and also commercially usable under BSD license

# TensorFlow:

- TensorFlow makes it easy for beginners and experts to create machine learning models for desktop, mobile, web, and cloud.
- It is used for implementing machine learning and deep learning applications.
- To develop and research on fascinating ideas on artificial intelligence, Google team created TensorFlow.
- TensorFlow is designed in Python programming language, hence it is considered an easy to understand framework.

- ## Features:

  - It includes a feature of that defines, optimizes and calculates mathematical expressions easily with the help of multi-dimensional arrays called tensors.
  - It includes a programming support of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques.
  - It includes a high scalable feature of computation with various data sets.
  - TensorFlow uses GPU computing, automating management. It also includes a unique feature of optimization of same memory and the data used.

# Keras:

- Keras is an open source deep learning framework for python.
- It has been developed by an artificial intelligence researcher at Google named Francois Chollet.
- Leading organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei and Uber are currently using Keras.

- ## Features

  - Keras leverages various optimization techniques to make high level neural network API easier and more performant. It supports the following features −
  - Consistent, simple and extensible API.
  - Minimal structure - easy to achieve the result without any frills.
  - It supports multiple platforms and backends.
  - It is user friendly framework which runs on both CPU and GPU.
  - Highly scalability of computation.
