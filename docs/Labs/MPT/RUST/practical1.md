## Practical 1 : Create a program in RUST to demonstrate println!

```
fn main() {
    println!("Good Morning!");
    let num = 12;
    println!("The number is {}", num);
    println!("The number2 is {num2}", num2 = 14);
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    let z = 3;
    println!("{0} + {1} = {2}", x, y, z);
}
```
