## Rust: Using Structs to Structure related Data:

- Defining and instantiating Structs
  - Using the field init shorthand when variables and fields have the same name
  - Creating instances from other instances with structs update syntax
  - Using tuple structs without named fields to create different types
  - Unit-like structs without any fields
- An example program using structs:
  - Refactoring with tuples
  - Refactoring with structs
  - Adding more meaning,
  - Adding useful functionality with derived traits
- Method syntax
  - Defining methods
  - methods with more parameters
  - Associated functions
  - Multiple impl blocks
