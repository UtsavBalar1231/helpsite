## Rust: Managing Growing Projects with Packages Crats and

- Modules:
  - Packages and crates

  - Paths for referring to an item in the module tree
    - Exposing paths with the pub keyword
    - Starting relative paths with super
- Making structs and enum public
- Bringing paths into scope with the `use` keyword:
  - Creating idiomatic `use` paths
- Providing `new`
- Names with the `as` keyword
- Re-exporting names with `pub` use
- Using external packages
- Using nested paths to clean up large use lists
- The glob operator
- Separating modules into different files.
