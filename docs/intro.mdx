# Vision and Values

## My Vision

My vision is to **be the authoritative reference point for conscious readers and adventurers** and to **encourage more people to start helping out each other** through curating lessons, lectures, practicals and tutorials.

## My Values

### Be Compassionate

I'll treat everyone who encounter me with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We do not take advantage of this helpsite for unethical purposes :smirk: and adopt mindful working practices so that I can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our virtual environment.

### Finally

This is not the right way to learning but it will help you complete the semester a bit more comfortably.
